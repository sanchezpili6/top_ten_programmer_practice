"""There is a game called "Unique Bid Auction". You can read more about it here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_bid_auction (though you don't have to do it to solve this problem).
Let's simplify this game a bit. Formally, there are n participants, the i-th participant chose the number ai.
The winner of the game is such a participant that the number he chose is unique (i. e. nobody else chose this number
except him) and is minimal (i. e. among all unique values of a the minimum one is the winning one).

Your task is to find the index of the participant who won the game (or -1 if there is no winner). Indexing is 1-based,
i. e. the participants are numbered from 1 to n.
You have to answer t independent test cases."""
